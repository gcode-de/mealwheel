Together we've been working on the app for the course of four weeks during the "capstone phase" of our web dev bootcamp at [NeueFische](https://github.com/neuefische).
We really had an awesome time together, motivated and challenged each other and grew together in a great way!

## Challenges
During the time working on the app we faced some really tricky challenges:
- **Working under realistic conditions:**
  - Formulating user stories for the desired features and having them approved by a third party
  - Drawing wireframes in excalidraw and a design mockup in Figma
  - Keeping an overview with a user story map on figma as well as a kanban board on github
  - Sharing the work using git with many of it's possibilities
  - Having the code for each user story approved in code-reviews (teachers and fellow students)
  - Undergoing quality-assurance in preview deployments
  - Getting new ideas and critical features by interviewing our peers and some test users of the app
- **Getting some critical features to work:**
  - Implementing login and auth with KINDE
  - Providing image upload and deletion with Cloudinary
  - Orchestrating all the data fetching, filter logic and API routes accessing MongoDB
  - Drag and Drop functionality to assign recipes to a different day in the planner
- **Creating an app people actually want to use:**
  Some of our excitement for this project came from us actually wanting to use it once it would be finished.
  We actively asked friends and family for their input on how to streamline the UX and on what features to include (or maybe delete again).
